  class MergeSortTester

  ALGORITHM:
  The algorithm works using recursion and a helper method entitled merge that takes two sorted lists and merges them. The recursion in sort checks if the inputted array is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns that array, and if not, it creates two lists of roughly half the length of the original array. Then, merge is called on the "sort" of the two halfs of the original list.

  BIG-OH CLASSIFICATION OF ALGORITHM:
  <INSERT YOUR EXECUTION TIME CATEGORIZATION OF MERGESORT HERE>

  Mean execution times for dataset of size n:
  Batch size: <# of times each dataset size was run>
  n=1       time: 1 
  n=10      time: 10x10
  n=100     time: 100x100
  ...
  n=<huge>  time: hugexhuge
